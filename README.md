First Project Using Bootstrap

This was a semi-guided bootstrap project from the web development bootcamp by Angela Yu. I was told to create a one-page website for a imaginary start-up called "Tindog". The goal images for each section, the texts to include were provided and little hints were given. I created everything with what I know from bootstrap, css and html.
